Proteins are the biological molecules that are the building blocks of cells and organs, and the biochemical processes required to keep living organisms alive are catalyzed and regulated by a particular category of proteins called enzymes.  Proteins are linear polymers of amino acids that fold into complex conformations dictated by the physical and chemical properties of the amino acid chain.  The biological function of a protein is dependent on the protein folding into the correct, or "native", state. Protein structure is described by biologists in terms of primary structure, which is the amino acid sequence, secondary structure, wherein the polypeptide backbone assembles into local regions of alpha-helices, beta-sheets, coils and turns, tertiary structure, which refers to the entire 3-dimensional structure of the protein, and quaternary structure, which describes interactions between separate polypeptide chains, called subunits, that exist in some large protein complexes.  Computational methods have been developed that can predict protein secondary structure with a reasonable degree of accuracy.  Prediction methods exist for predicting tertiary structure, but the accuracy of such methods is highly dependent on whether or not the protein in question is related in sequence to any members of the existing library of known protein structures.  The development of <foreign>ab initio</foreign> tools to predict the complete structural fold of a protein from its amino acid sequence is a burgeoning field in computational biology, but true attainment of this goal is still pretty distant.

Protein folding is usually a spontaneous process, and often when a protein unfolds because of heat or chemical denaturation, it will be capable of refolding into the correct conformation, as soon as it is removed from the environment of the denaturant, meaning folding and unfolding under these circumstances are reversible.  
Protein folding can go wrong for many reasons. When an egg is boiled, the proteins in the white unfold and misfold into a solid mass of protein that will not refold or redissolve. In a similar way, irreversibly misfolded proteins form insoluble protein aggregates found in certain tissues that are characteristic of some diseases, such as Alzheimer's Disease.
    </para>
		<para id="para2">
Determining the process by which proteins fold into particular shapes, characteristic of their amino acid sequence, is commonly called "the protein folding problem".  One approach to studying the protein folding process is the application of statistical mechanics techniques and simulations to the 
<cite target-id="clementi"><cite-title>study of protein folding.</cite-title></cite> (1) These methods allow the investigation of larger systems than methods that try to represent atomic detail in their simulations of biological molecules, and have had success correlating the computational folding model with folding intermediates and transition states that have been experimentally measured for a limited test set of relatively large proteins.

Although attempts at predicting tertiary and quaternary structure from the amino acid sequence of proteins are relatively new, methods for predicting protein secondary structure have been in existence for some time.  Depending on the method, secondary structure predictions can be performed with approximately 60 - 70% accuracy.  Originally, empirical prediction methods were based on tables which listed each amino acid and the frequency with which that amino acid was found in alpha-helices, beta-sheets, turns and random coil.  Currently, prediction methods usually employ machine learning in the form of neural networks that are trained with test sets consisting of sequences with known structure.  In these cases, the selection of the test set is critically related to the accuracy of the method.  However, given the ever increasing number of known structural folds, selecting a representative test set that includes many proteins of diverse structure has become easier.

With the publication of entire genomes that contain sequences to many unknown proteins, scientists would love to have the ability to predict the final folded structure of a protein based on its sequence.  Although this is not yet a practical reality, tools exist that can predict secondary structure with some accuracy and inroads are being made toward solving the protein folding problem.  Elucidating the mechanisms behind protein folding would provide important knowledge for fighting disease states where misfolded proteins are implicated.
