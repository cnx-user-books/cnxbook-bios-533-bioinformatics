    <para id="intro">
  Proteins that have a significant biological relationship to one another often share only isolated regions of sequence similarity.  For identifying relationships of this nature, the ability to find local regions of optimal similarity is advantageous over global alignments that optimize the overall alignment of two entire sequences. 
<cite target-id="blast"><cite-title>BLAST</cite-title></cite>,
 or Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (1), is an alignment tool that  
uses a measure of local similarity to score sequence alignments in such a way as to identify regions of good local alignment.

    <para id="para1">
The basic BLAST algorithm can be implemented in DNA and protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in long DNA sequences.  There are 5 BLAST options on the NCBI web site.  BLASTP compares any amino acid query sequence against a protein sequence database.  Similarly, BLASTN compares a nucleotide sequence against a nucleotide sequence database.  BLASTX takes a nucleotide query sequence and translates it in all reading frames for comparison against a protein sequence database.  TBLASTN compares a protein sequence against a nucleotide sequence database, translating the nucleotide database sequences in all possible reading frames.  TBLASTX compares translations of a nucleotide query sequence against translations of a nucleotide sequence database.  Sequences must be input in one of three formats; FASTA sequence format, NCBI Accession numbers, or GIs (GenBank Identifiers).  The FASTA format is the only format where you can input a sequence, instead of a number or code identifying a gene that has already been deposited in GenBank, so this is the format that must be used for nonpublished sequences.  Take a moment to view the

Consider the following nucleotide sequence, which is in FASTA format, but lacks 
the single-line description that identifies it source:

    <para id="para4">Access the <link url="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/">NCBI BLAST home page
</link>, and click on the link 
for nucleotide BLAST (BLASTN), the standard BLAST for searching a nucleotide database with a 
nucleotide query sequence.  Highlight and copy the FASTA sequence above, and paste it 
into the first box on the BLAST query page.  
BLAST allows the option of querying over only a subset of the query sequence, 
identified by numerical order in the "query subrange" boxes next to the query.  If it were desirable to query with only the subsequence beginning 
with the 50th nucleotide of the example sequence and ending with the 250th 
nucleotide, then the number 50 would be entered into the "From" box and 250 
would be entered into the "To" box.  Here in this example the entire sequence 
should be used as the query, so these boxes should be left blank. 
The database can be selected under "Choose Search Set". There are many available database choices you can view from the pull down menu. The "nr/nt" database is the largest nucleotide database available through NCBI BLAST; select the "nr/nt" database for this exercise.  It includes all GenBank, RefSeq Nucleotides, EMBL (European nucleotide database), DDBJ (Japanese nucleotide database) and PDB (Protein Data Bank) sequences, but no EST, STS, GSS, or phase 0, 1 or 2 htgs (unfinished high throughput genomic) sequences.    The NCBI nr database originally got its name from the phrase "nonredundant" nucleotide database, but there is no longer any claim to nonredundancy in the sequence set.  Choosing the largest database is not always best; 
in fact, often the 
goal is to find a match from a specific organism, for example, a lab that works with flies (<foreign>
 "Drosophila melanogaster" </foreign>) as the model organism might be only interested in their organism's sequences. 
In that case, there is a box entitled Organism, where a user interested can type in <foreign>
 "Drosophila melanogaster" </foreign>.
   </para>
    <para id="para5">Under program selection, the user can choose to optimize blastn for the type of sequence search that best relates to their problem, for highly similar sequences (megablast), more dissimilar sequences (discontiguous megablast)or somewhat similar sequences (blastn).  At the bottom of the web page, there is a link that allows the user to view the default values for formatting 
(return the descriptions for the top 100 scoring alignments) and for the algorithm parameters.  If you selected megablast, optimize for highly similar sequences, the word size used in the search will automatically default to 28 nucleotides.  If you select blastn to optimize for somewhat similar sequences the word size will be 11 nucleotides, the historically common default value for blastn.
For the purposes of this example, select to optimize for somewhat similar sequences (blastn) and click on the BLAST button to submit your query to 
the BLAST queue.

BLAST should state that the query was successfully submitted, and provide a 
request ID that accesses the results. The page updates itself 
automatically, you do not have to refresh it.

    <para id="para6"> 
The results begin with a graphical overview that uses the query sequence as the 
rule, shown separately at the top of the graph.  In this example, the rule 
(our query sequence) is 453 nucleotides in length.  The score of each alignment 
is divided into one of 5 ranges by the five different colors in the color key 
provided, and the alignments are placed in the order of best scores first.  The 
scores are normalized, and normalized scores are given in units  of bits, to 
allow comparisons between alignments.  More information on scores can and 
should be perused in the <link url="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/tutorial/Altschul-1.html">Altschul tutorial</link> 
on the NCBI website.  Clicking on any of the first 50 lines in the graph takes 
the user to the associated alignment, located in the last section of this results
page.

<para id="para6a">The second section of the results page, immediately following the graph, contains 
the top 100 alignment scores and their sequence descriptions.  Here, the "hits", or matched sequences returned as a list of results, contain links to their GenBank entries, their GenBank definitions under the column entitled "Accession", the normalized scores of 
the alignments, and the E-values. The E-values 
quantify the probability that the listed alignment might occur randomly. The scores are linked to the actual alignment further down the page.  Clicking on a score will take you directly to the alignment that obtained that score. 
In some cases, there are icons containing capital letters in the links column, which are links to related entries in one of the NCBI databases, such as <link url="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/UniGene/">

  The alignments are represented with vertical lines illustrating identical 
matches, blanks indicate no match.  In these nucleotide alignments, there is 
no measurement for similarity between non-identical nucleotides.   In protein alignments, however, chemical or structural similarity is 
usually identified between the amino acids.

and select the blastx "translated nucleotide sequence query".  Cut and paste the same nucleotide sequence used in the 
previous example into the "Search" box.  The default translation tool is BLASTX, which translates the query sequence into a protein sequence and searches 
a protein database.  To search a translated 
nucleotide database with a protein query,  the TBLASTN algorithm should be selected.  To search a translated nucleotide database 
with a translated nucleotide sequence, the choice would be TBLASTX.  TBLASTX 
is the most computationally intensive of these three searches, therefore 
common practice is to use BLASTX first to search protein sequence databases, and then if there are no hits with 
BLASTX, consider TBLASTX to translate nucleotide sequence database entries into protein sequences.  For this example, use the translation algorithm BLASTX.
Use the nr database and leave the default values for all other BLAST options, and hit BLAST.

This protein sequence is highly 
conserved across several species, a trait that is often a sign of physiological 
importance.  Scroll through the protein alignments.  Notice that alignment 
between amino acids is illustrated differently than alignment between 
nucleotides.  An identical match is shown by listing the one letter amino acid 
code in the middle row, between the two aligned sequences.  A mismatch is 
indicated by a blank, but similarity is indicated by the "+" sign, meaning the 
amino acids are not identical, but they have some of the same chemical or structural properties.  Gaps are indicated by hyphens in the sequence that contains the 
gaps.  Gaps are penalized in an alignment, and cause the normalized score to be lower.

from the selected chromosome is shown, and blue, capitalized bases illustrate 
the matching region(s).  Notice that the query cDNA sequence is missing a large 
region of DNA that is present in the chromosome.  The pairwise alignment is 
shown below the genomic sequence.  Return to the original results summary and

This has been an introduction to BLAST sequence alignment, designed to give an 
idea of some of the different ways to optimize searches and problems that require the use 
of sequence alignment tools. Subsequent modules in this course will build on this 
foundation, exploring advanced techniques and additional alignment tools.
