    <para id="intro">
A proteome is the collection of all the proteins within a given organism, 
in the same way a genome is the collection of all the genes within a given 
organism.  A proteome has some characteristics that are quite different from 
a genome, however.  A principal difference is the fact that while a particular 
organism will have the same set of identical DNA in any undamaged, healthy cell 
throughout its lifetime, the organism's proteins will differ greatly from one 
tissue to another, and from one life stage to another.  Furthermore, proteins 
commonly incur a variety of chemical modifications after they are made.
These modifications are critical for proper protein functioning and/or 
regulation, and moreover, these modifications cannot be determined with 
certainty by looking at the DNA sequence alone. In a contempary high-throughput 
proteomics laboratory, the number of proteins identified and analyzed in one 
day can be on the order of hundreds.
    </para>
    <para id="para1">
The term “proteome” was originally coined by an Australian scientist, 
<cite target-id="proteome"><cite-title>Mark Wilkins</cite-title></cite> (1), to describe the "PROTEin complement of the genOME".  
The term "proteomics" is used relatively loosely to describe any and all of the 
collection of high throughput techniques that have emerged to enable the 
scientist to analyze all the proteins expressed under a certain set of 
conditions within an individual cell or organism.  
The <cite target-id="expasy"><cite-title>ExPASy</cite-title></cite> (Expert Protein Analysis System) website (2), 
Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, offers the definition that 
"proteomics can be defined as the qualitative and quantitative comparison of 
proteomes under different conditions to further unravel biological processes."
    </para>
    <para id="para2a">
Common techniques for identifying the proteins within a proteome are 2D-PAGE 
(polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) gels, amino acid (AA) composition analysis,
 peptide mass fingerprinting and other mass spectroscopy applications.  
A good starting point for becoming acquainted with 2D gels is the 
<link url="http://www.aber.ac.uk/parasitology/Proteome/Tut_2D.html#Section%201">
2D PAGE tutorial</link> offered by the Institute of Biological Sciences, 
University of Wales at Aberystwyth.  ExPASy offers a good synopsis of 
<link url="http://us.expasy.org/ch2d/protocols/protocols.fm13.html">
peptide mass fingerprinting and AA composition analysis</link> techniques, 
for those who are unfamiliar with these methods.  
    </para>
    <para id="para2b">
At the <link url="http://us.expasy.org/tools/">
ExPASy Proteomics Tools server</link>, the first category of tools are for 
protein identification and characterization.  Take a look at the tools listed 
in this section.  These tools are designed to identify the proteins that make 
up the proteome of study, using the data received from gels, AA analysis and 
mass spectroscopy experiments.

Scroll down on the ExPASy tools webpage to the section entitled "pattern and 
profile searches".  The tools that populate this section are designed to 
identify proteins that belong to well characterized protein families, 
usually identified by conserved domains within family members.  
Also, well known protein motifs, or domains, are represented independently 
of their protein families in pattern databases that contain the conserved 
aspects of the domain sequence.  Select the tool entitled <cite target-id="interpro"><cite-title>
"InterPro Scan"</cite-title></cite> (3) 
to perform an integrated search in PROSITE, Pfam, PRINTS and other family 
and domain databases.  This tool is useful for identifying specific domains 
or motifs within a protein, once  the sequence has been determined, and can 
sometimes recognize the protein as a member of an established protein family.  
Test the efficacy of this tool with the following sequences, one at a time, but make sure 
the interactive run button is selected.  An email address will be required 
to submit the job, but the results can be viewed in the browser interactively.

Once a protein sequence has been determined
through proteomics techniques, bioinformatics can be used to predict certain
types of topology.  Topology is the sequence of secondary structure elements
within a protein.  The most basic secondary structure elements within proteins are the alpha helix, the beta sheet and the random coil.  However, some
algorithms will predict topological features that are closely related to
<foreign>in vivo</foreign>
